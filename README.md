> ⚠️ **No Release Yet** - Will Release A beta version once the prototype is working! <br>

A high-performance Minecraft-style voxel engine written in C# + Unity. The idea is to combine [Distant Horizons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/distant-horizons) Level Details (Removing Minecraft render distance) and [Cubic Chunks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencubicchunks) (Remove build limit of Minecraft) to achieve massive render distances and unlimited world height — without vanilla C# overhead.


## How does this shit work?
### 1. Voxels & Rendering
- Voxels are stored in a contiguous array. Each block generates only the visible faces (face culling), and Textures are drawn from a single [atlas](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Atlas) to reduce draw calls.
- Each [chunk](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Chunk) is built into a single combined mesh instead of instantiating cubes individually. The mesh can be split per side to allow side-based culling (disabling unseen faces).

### 2. Mesh & Vertex Optimization
- Vertex positions are whole numbers ((0,0,0), (1,0,0)), allowing them to be stored as bytes, which drastically reduces the vertex memory footprint.
- Mesh data is generated directly in memory for maximum Burst Compatibility

### 3. Chunk System (Cubic Chunks)
- Replaces Minecraft's flat chunk system and uses [Cubic Chunks](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/opencubicchunks) to support infinite vertical expansion
- Chunks load **dynamically** both horizontally and vertically
- Each vertical column loads or unloads based on the player’s height.

## Optimization 
### Burst Compiler
- All Code must be Burst-compatible instead of vanilla C#
### Occlusion Culling and LOD
- LOD meshes are combined to reduce draw calls
- Hidden chunks (behind terrain) are not rendered at all
### Greedy Meshing
- Adjacent faces are merged into larger quads, which greatly reduces the triangle count
### Multithreading (finally lol)
- All world generation and mesh creation occur off the main thread (using Unity Job System and C# Task System)
- Terrain and Chunk Data are parallelized to use multiple cores effectively

## Terrain Generation
### Perlin Noise and Fractal Brownian Motion
- Inspired by [Sebastian Lague's Procedural Landmass Generation Guide](https://github.com/SebLague/Procedural-Landmass-Generation)
- Terrain height = exponential function of noise (for natural mountain ranges)
### Performance
- Integrated FastNoiseSIMD, for fast multi-core noise evaluation
- Parallelized across worker threads for near-instant chunk generation
